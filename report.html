    <h1>Oblig 1 report:</h1>
    <p>When creating the restaurant page, we first created a basic version with a lot of placeholders. At this stage, it was easy to implement accessibility features like adding &lt;img&gt; alt attributes which also included placeholder text describing the picture. After adding proper images, we added suitable alt attributes which would describe the picture in case it would not load, or someone was using a screen reader. </p>
    <p>We also made sure the website was usable with a keyboard only. Using the tab key lets you go through the different buttons on the website and pressing enter would direct you to the corresponding page or section. A small menu list was also added in the menu page. This would let you skip directly to either the launch, dinner or dessert section of the menu using only the tab and enter key in case using the arrow keys are not an option or the user prefer not to use them.</p>
    <p>All links (&lt;a&gt; tags) on the page has hover effects to clearly visualize that the user can interact with the button. The booking and contact forms also have an underline on the section currently in use to make it easier to see what you are doing and where you are on the page. The links have proper code so that screen reader understand what the links are used for. For example, the mail link has mailto: to link to an actual email address. The phone number link used tel: so that clicking the number on a mobile device (or a computer connected to a phone) could call the number directly from the site.</p>
    <p>We considered adding background images to the page for a more unique viewer experience, but we decided not to due to increased load times and sometimes making it difficult to distinguish between text and background. By adding background color to the text on top of images, we could have solved the readability issues, but we found that it interfered with the overall theme of the website. We decided to stick to black text on a white background for better readability and easy access, though we did add some blue highlight on some text and around important content to fit the color scheme of the restaurant.</p>
    <p>Since we have yet to learn much about responsiveness and media queries, we have not optimized the website to work on all devices. The best experience will be on normal desktop monitors, but we did add some max-width and max-height attributes to make it work on smaller laptops as well. On a normal desktop monitor, the website works well up to a zoom-level of 175% but going to 200% causes some overlap and wrapping issues with certain content.</p>
    <p>We used <a href="https://achecker.achecks.ca/checker/index.php">AChecker.com</a> to see if there were any problems with the website. It did not detect any problems. It did return a lot of potential problems, but none of them were issues affecting our website as it was just potential problems like "alt description might not describe image" even though it does and "alt description might not be needed as the image is purely decorative" which is wrong, the images used were of the dishes and serves it purpose by giving the user a visual representation of what the dish will look like.</p>
